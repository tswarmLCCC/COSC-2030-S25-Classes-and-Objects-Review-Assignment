# Lesson plan

  In the procedural version, we define three functions `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `transfer` that simulate the corresponding operations on a bank account. We also define two `BankAccount` structs that represent two bank accounts.

  In the object-oriented version, we define a `BankAccount` class that has attributes `account_number`, `account_holder`, and `balance`, and methods `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `transfer`. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the attributes of the class.

  By using object-oriented programming, we can encapsulate the data and methods related to a bank account in a single class. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand. We can also create multiple instances of the `BankAccount` class, each with its own account number, account holder, and balance, and perform operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and transfer on them.
